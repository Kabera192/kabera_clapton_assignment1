# Class Servlet Assignment
Assignment on Java Servlets.

## Description
The project is a simple Java Servlet project that has a login page where one can enter their email and password and get redirected to either the home page,
if the email and password are the ones specified in the source code(yes, they are hard coded), or to a forgot-password page.

This project was a fun way to just get started with servlet technology and what it can do.
